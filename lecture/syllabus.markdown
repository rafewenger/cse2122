> It goes against the grain of modern education to teach [students] to
> program. What fun is there in making plans, acquiring discipline in
> organizing thoughts, devoting attention to detail and learning to be
> self-critical? -- *Alan J. Perlis, Epigrams on Programming*

## Homeworks

This material will be challenging. Consider the class like a math or
physics class. It will require a lot of thinking, staring at the
problem, planning a solution with pen & paper, etc. It's almost
impossible to fake your way through it. There are always many ways to
"solve" a programming problem, but there is an obvious difference
between code that shows you understand your solution and code that
shows you just tried every possibility. You will be graded higher if
your solution is incomplete but intelligent, than if your solution is
just a mess. Additionally, code that actually works (even if it's
incomplete) is much better than code that has errors.

Most students say that programming assignments take longer than they
expected. Trivial bugs in your code can cause you to waste hours
attempting to fix your program. The last 10% of the work takes 90% of
the time. And so on. So start early!

Or if you prefer,

> **Murphy's law of Programming** "The sooner you start coding your program,
> the longer it is going to take." -- *The computer contradictionary*

## Text book

Walter Savitch, Problem Solving with C++, 8th Edition.

The book is not required, but you may find it highly useful. I
generally follow the book's organization, and most homeworks are
straight from the book.  Probably any edition would be fine; 
the latest edition is the 8th edition.

## Academic misconduct policy

This course is designed for individual work.

All programming assignments are to be done by yourself.
You may discuss programming assignments with other students in the class
but DO NOT LOOK AT ANYONE'S CODE OTHER THAN YOUR OWN.
Needless to say, you should not share or copy anyone else's code.


## Disability statement

Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the
impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss your
specific needs. Please contact the Office for Disability Services at
614-292-3307 in room 150 Pomerene Hall to coordinate reasonable
accommodations for students with documented disabilities.

## Some inspiration

> In my life as an architect, I find that the single thing which
> inhibits young professionals, new students most severely, is their
> acceptance of standards that are too low. If I ask a student whether
> her design is as good as Chartres, she often smiles tolerantly at me
> as if to say, "Of course not, that isn't what I am trying to
> do... I could never do that."

> Then, I express my disagreement, and tell her: "That standard must
> be our standard. If you are going to be a builder, no other standard
> is worthwhile. That is what I expect of myself in my own buildings,
> and it is what I expect of my students." Gradually, I show the
> students that they have a right to ask this of themselves, and
> must ask this of themselves. Once that level of standard is in their
> minds, they will be able to figure out, for themselves, how to do
> better, how to make something that is as profound as that.

> Two things emanate from this changed standard. First, the work
> becomes more fun. It is deeper, it never gets tiresome or boring,
> because one can never really attain this standard. One's work
> becomes a lifelong work, and one keeps trying and trying. So it
> becomes very fulfilling, to live in the light of a goal like this.

> But secondly, it does change what people are trying to do. It takes
> away from them the everyday, lower-level aspiration that is purely
> technical in nature, (and which we have come to accept) and replaces
> it with something deep, which will make a real difference to all of
> us that inhabit the earth. -- Christopher Alexander, from the
> Foreword to *Patterns of Software* by Richard P. Gabriel
